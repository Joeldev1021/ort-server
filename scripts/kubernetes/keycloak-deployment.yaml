  # The volume configuration for Keycloak is split between a Persistent Volume and a Persistent Volume Claim.
  # For Minikube, the volume type is `hostPath` which is the only supported value. In production another type will be
  # used such as `local`.

    # This directory should be mounted with `minikube mount` to contain Keycloak initialization script.
    # The mount can be verified with `minikube ssh`.
